# Instructions for Agents

* **Read the Roadmap**: Before starting any task, read `ROADMAP.md` to understand the project status and identifying the next steps.
* **Update the Roadmap**: After completing a task, update `ROADMAP.md` by marking the corresponding checkboxes as checked (change `[ ]` to `[x]`).
* **Split Tasks**: A session may split a task into subtasks if it is more realistic to implement with success.
